I have tried to predict probabilty of a person to have COVID-19 on two different days.

Having tried various regression algorithm, Random Forest Regressor gave me Minimum MSE. I proceded to find the probabilty value at 20th March trained model. 

I used VECTOR auto-regressive (VAR) for solving the Time Series Data of Diuresis value. I used the predicted value to predict the probabilty for 27th March.
